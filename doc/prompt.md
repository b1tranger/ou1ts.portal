User: #target: making a new page, contributions.html

#idea: 
- the new page will be linked in index.html under "Official UITS" category, with a bar separating from the rest.
- the pageis for listing the contributors who have submitted their resource info through the "Submit Resource" button.
- as a reference, use this website: https://diuqbank.com/contributors/
- state the reference clearly at the very bottom of the new page.
- keep the CSS theme consistent with index.html and the other category pages
- do not change anything else other than index.html.

Read [](file:///e%3A/Git_WIP/2.%20Personal%20Repositories/ou1ts.portal/official.html)

Now let me read the rest of index.html to see the full structure including where the "Official UITS" category card is:

Read [](file:///e%3A/Git_WIP/2.%20Personal%20Repositories/ou1ts.portal/style.css#1-1), lines 1 to 100

Now I have all the context I need. Let me create the contributions.html page and update index.html. I'll:

1. Create contributions.html with a contributors list layout inspired by the reference website
2. Update index.html to add a link to contributions.html under the "Official UITS" category with a divider 

Created [](file:///e%3A/Git_WIP/2.%20Personal%20Repositories/ou1ts.portal/contributions.html)

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
I've completed both tasks:

1. **Created contributions.html** - A new page for listing contributors who submit resources through the "Submit Resource" button. The page includes:
   - Header with back button, icon, and "Submit Resource" button
   - An info banner explaining the page's purpose
   - An empty state with a call-to-action for first-time contributors
   - A commented-out contributors grid template ready to be populated when contributors are added
   - Reference footer at the bottom crediting the design inspiration from https://diuqbank.com/contributors/

2. **Updated index.html** - Added the "Contributors" category card under "Official UITS" with:
   - A horizontal divider separating it from the other categories
   - A green-themed icon (fa-users) with matching gradient background
   - Description "Resource Submitters"

The CSS styling is consistent with the existing pages, using the same color scheme, card styles, and layout patterns.

User: let's brainstorm.

I am taking the submissions by a Google Form, that will be stored in a Google Sheet. But then I will have to manually update the website contents as I add the submitted resources to the intended locations. 
Is there a way to automate this process? Can a website pull data directly from Google Sheet? For example, any new submissions will add a new section in the contributions.html

GitHub Copilot: Yes, absolutely! There are several ways to pull data directly from Google Sheets to your website. Here are the main options:

## Option 1: Published Google Sheet (Simplest - No API Key)

1. **Publish your Google Sheet** to the web (File → Share → Publish to web)
2. Use the sheet's public JSON/CSV endpoint
3. Fetch with JavaScript and render dynamically

```javascript
// Example: Fetch from published sheet
const SHEET_ID = 'your-sheet-id';
const SHEET_NAME = 'Form Responses 1';
const url = `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/${SHEET_ID}/gviz/tq?tqx=out:json&sheet=${SHEET_NAME}`;

fetch(url)
  .then(res => res.text())
  .then(data => {
    // Parse and render contributors
  });
```

**Pros:** Free, no API key, simple  
**Cons:** Data is publicly accessible, slight delay in updates

---

## Option 2: Google Sheets API (More Control)

- Requires a Google Cloud project and API key
- More reliable and structured responses
- Can handle private sheets with OAuth

---

## Option 3: Third-Party Services

| Service | Free Tier | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| **SheetDB** | 500 req/month | Easy REST API |
| **Sheety** | 200 req/month | Simple JSON API |
| **Sheet.best** | 100 req/month | Quick setup |

---

## My Recommendation for Your Use Case

**Option 1 (Published Sheet)** is ideal because:
- Your data isn't sensitive (contributor names are public anyway)
- Zero cost
- No backend needed
- Works with your static HTML site

Would you like me to implement this for contributions.html? I would:

1. Add JavaScript to fetch data from your Google Sheet
2. Dynamically render contributor cards based on form responses
3. The page will auto-update whenever new submissions are added to the sheet

Just share your Google Sheet ID (or the form response sheet), and let me know which columns contain the contributor info (name, ID, etc.).

User: please do. Here is the Google Sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oQ5Mkavjm62UGZwNjM-52yvKppWZHfX-Qpq6jtEVIOY/edit?usp=sharing

What steps do I need to follow?

GitHub Copilot: Read [](file:///e%3A/Git_WIP/2.%20Personal%20Repositories/ou1ts.portal/contributions.html#1-1), lines 1 to 220

Read [](file:///e%3A/Git_WIP/2.%20Personal%20Repositories/ou1ts.portal/contributions.html#220-220), lines 220 to 249

Now I need to check your Google Sheet structure to understand the column names. But first, here are the steps you need to follow:

---

## Steps You Need to Follow:

### Step 1: Publish Your Google Sheet to the Web
1. Open your Google Sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oQ5Mkavjm62UGZwNjM-52yvKppWZHfX-Qpq6jtEVIOY/
2. Go to **File → Share → Publish to web**
3. In the dialog:
   - Select the sheet tab that contains form responses (usually "Form Responses 1")
   - Choose **"Entire Document"** or the specific sheet
   - Click **"Publish"**
4. Confirm by clicking "OK"

### Step 2: Tell Me Your Column Names
What are the column headers in your Google Form responses? For example:
- Timestamp
- Name
- Email
- Student ID
- Resource Link
- etc.

---

Once you confirm the sheet is published and share the column names, I'll update contributions.html to automatically fetch and display contributors from the sheet.

**Quick question:** Would you like to display:
- **All unique contributors** (grouped by name, showing count of submissions)?
- **OR each individual submission** as a separate entry?

User: I want to display "All unique contributors" grouped by "Your Name"

Here are the column names: Timestamp	Email Address	Student Education Email	What is this submission for?	Your Name	Contacts and Social Links	Project Title	Project Link	Project Type	Department	Batch

GitHub Copilot: Using "Replace String in File"


```

```


Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Done! I've updated contributions.html to automatically fetch and display contributors from your Google Sheet.

## What You Need to Do:

### Publish Your Google Sheet to the Web
1. Open your sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oQ5Mkavjm62UGZwNjM-52yvKppWZHfX-Qpq6jtEVIOY/
2. Go to **File → Share → Publish to web**
3. Click **"Publish"** and confirm

That's it! Once published, the page will automatically:
- Fetch all form submissions
- Group by **"Your Name"** column
- Display unique contributors sorted by number of submissions (highest first)
- Show their **Department** and **Batch** as subtitle
- Show colorful avatar with initials
- Auto-update whenever new submissions are added (on page refresh)

## Features Implemented:
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Loading state** | Shows spinner while fetching data |
| **Empty state** | Displays if no submissions yet |
| **Error state** | Shows if fetch fails |
| **Dynamic avatars** | Colored circles with initials |
| **Contribution count** | Shows number of resources submitted |
| **Sorted by contributions** | Top contributors appear first |

Made changes.

User: the empty state is not working

GitHub Copilot: Read [](file:///e%3A/Git_WIP/2.%20Personal%20Repositories/ou1ts.portal/contributions.html#180-180), lines 180 to 280

I see the issue. The problem is that if the Google Sheet isn't published yet or the fetch fails silently, the error might not be caught properly. Also, if the sheet has a header row, it might be counted as data. Let me fix the script with better error handling and skip the header row: 

Read [](file:///e%3A/Git_WIP/2.%20Personal%20Repositories/ou1ts.portal/contributions.html#280-280), lines 280 to 389

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Fixed! The changes include:

1. **Better error handling** - Now properly catches network errors and invalid responses
2. **Validates Google Sheet response format** - Checks if the sheet is actually published
3. **Skips header rows** - Filters out rows where the name equals "Your Name" (column header)
4. **Proper display styling** - Changed `display: block` to `display: flex` for centered content

**Important:** Have you published your Google Sheet to the web yet? If not:

1. Open: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oQ5Mkavjm62UGZwNjM-52yvKppWZHfX-Qpq6jtEVIOY/
2. Go to **File → Share → Publish to web**
3. Select **"Entire Document"** and click **Publish**

If it's still showing the loading spinner or error state, open the browser console (F12 → Console tab) and let me know what error message appears.

```

```
Done! I've updated contributions.html with the following features:

### New Features Added:

1. **Student Education Email Display**
   - Now shows the contributor's education email below their name on each card

2. **Clickable Cards with Modal Popup**
   - Clicking any contributor card opens a modal/popup window
   - Modal shows:
     - Contributor's name and email in the header
     - Avatar with initials
     - List of all submitted resources with:
       - **Project Title**
       - **Project Type** (as a badge)
       - **Project Link** (clickable, opens in new tab)

3. **Modal Interactions**
   - Click the ✕ button to close
   - Click outside the modal to close
   - Press **Escape** key to close
   - Smooth slide-in animation

### Column Mapping Updated:
| Index | Column Name |
|-------|-------------|
| 2 | Student Education Email |
| 4 | Your Name |
| 6 | Project Title |
| 7 | Project Link |
| 8 | Project Type |
| 9 | Department |
| 10 | Batch |

User: I want to add another feature to the card pop-up windows for submissions/contributions. Observer the provided image. I need to:
- The contribution or resource type should be a link to the corresponding page. For example: in the image, it shows that the submitted resource type is "Tools". Therefore, the text should be a clickable link to the page "tools.html"

GitHub Copilot: Read [](file:///e%3A/Git_WIP/2.%20Personal%20Repositories/ou1ts.portal/contributions.html#1-1), lines 1 to 100

Read [](file:///e%3A/Git_WIP/2.%20Personal%20Repositories/ou1ts.portal/script.js)

Let me continue reading the script.js file to find the popup implementation and more of the contributions.html file: 

Read [](file:///e%3A/Git_WIP/2.%20Personal%20Repositories/ou1ts.portal/script.js#105-105), lines 105 to 105

Read [](file:///e%3A/Git_WIP/2.%20Personal%20Repositories/ou1ts.portal/contributions.html#100-100), lines 100 to 350

Let me continue reading to find the JavaScript code that generates the popup and modal: 

Read [](file:///e%3A/Git_WIP/2.%20Personal%20Repositories/ou1ts.portal/contributions.html#350-350), lines 350 to 600

Let me continue reading to find where the modal resources are populated: 

Read [](file:///e%3A/Git_WIP/2.%20Personal%20Repositories/ou1ts.portal/contributions.html#600-600), lines 600 to 807

Now I understand the code structure. The resource type is rendered in the modal around line 755. I need to:

1. Create a mapping from resource type to the corresponding page URL
2. Update the resource type span to be a clickable link

I also need to add some CSS styling for the link. Let me implement this: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Now let me add the type-to-page mapping and update the resource rendering logic: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Now let me update the resource rendering to make the type a clickable link: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
The changes have been implemented. Here's a summary of what was done:

1. **Added hover styling for the resource type link** - The `.resource-type` class now includes `text-decoration: none` and `transition`, plus a new `a.resource-type:hover` rule that changes the background and text color on hover.

2. **Created a resource type to page URL mapping** - Added a `resourceTypePages` object that maps resource types like "Tools", "Courses", "Materials", "Community", "Official", "Portfolio/Portfolios" to their corresponding HTML pages.

3. **Added a helper function `getResourceTypePage()`** - This function looks up the page URL for a given resource type, supporting both exact and case-insensitive matching.

4. **Updated the resource rendering logic** - The resource type badge is now rendered as a clickable `<a>` link when a matching page exists, or falls back to a plain `<span>` if no page mapping is found.

Now when users click on a resource type like "Tools" in the popup, it will navigate them to tools.html.

Made changes.

User: update the documentation at "doc/DOCUMENTATION.md"

GitHub Copilot:

User: create a "guidance.html" similar to the attached files. I have added the "Resource type to page URL mapping" for it in "contributions.html"

GitHub Copilot: Read [](file:///e%3A/Git_WIP/2.%20Personal%20Repositories/ou1ts.portal/contributions.html#1-1), lines 1 to 150

Searched for text `guidance` (`**/contributions.html`), 2 results

Read [](file:///e%3A/Git_WIP/2.%20Personal%20Repositories/ou1ts.portal/contributions.html#680-680), lines 680 to 750

Now I understand the structure. The "Guidance" category is mapped to "guidance.html". Let me look at the index.html to see if there's a category card for "Guidance" to understand what icon and colors to use: 

Read [](file:///e%3A/Git_WIP/2.%20Personal%20Repositories/ou1ts.portal/index.html#1-1), lines 1 to 150

Read [](file:///e%3A/Git_WIP/2.%20Personal%20Repositories/ou1ts.portal/index.html#150-150), lines 150 to 230

Now I have a good understanding of the structure. Looking at the existing category pages and the index.html, I notice that "Guidance" doesn't have a card in the index.html yet, but it's mapped in the contributions.html. I'll create a guidance.html file following the same structure as other category pages like tools.html, materials.html, etc.

For the Guidance page, I'll use a suitable icon (lightbulb or compass for guidance) and appropriate colors. Let me create the file: 

Created [](file:///e%3A/Git_WIP/2.%20Personal%20Repositories/ou1ts.portal/guidance.html)

I've created guidance.html following the same structure as the other category pages (tools.html, materials.html, community.html, etc.). 

The page includes:
- Same header structure with back button, category icon, title, and "ADD LINK" button
- Light blue gradient theme (`#e1f5fe` to `#b3e5fc`) with a lightbulb icon (`#0288d1`) to represent guidance
- Title: **Guidance** with subtitle **Tips & Tutorials**
- Empty `project-list` container with a commented template for adding guidance resources
- The `copyLink()` function for copying URLs

The page is ready to be populated with guidance resources as they are submitted through the form.

Made changes.

User: could you add the card that will be linked with "guidance.html" in "index,html"?

GitHub Copilot: Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Done! I've added the **Guidance** card to index.html right after the "Official UITS" card and before the divider. The card uses the same light blue theme as the guidance.html page with a lightbulb icon.

Made changes.

User: #target: I want to add a backend logic throughout the website.

#specification:
- user registration and login using student ID, Email and password
- backend stack: undecided (suggest me whether Node.js or PHP would be better. also which database  should go with. I want to host it on vercel)
- logged in users can take some actions in the website, like "star"ing listed resources, that will be used to rank the added resources in the list
- the home page should show a log in button on top right. it should show the login info (ID+Email) after loggin in and a log out button.

#note: create a plan first and let me decide

GitHub Copilot: # Backend Implementation Plan

## Stack Recommendation

**For Vercel hosting, I strongly recommend Node.js over PHP:**

| Factor | Node.js | PHP |
|--------|---------|-----|
| Vercel Support | ✅ Native (serverless functions) | ❌ Not supported |
| Ecosystem | Modern, great for APIs | Traditional, needs different host |
| Auth Libraries | Excellent (JWT, bcrypt, etc.) | Good, but wrong platform |

**Database Recommendation: Supabase (PostgreSQL)**

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **Supabase** ⭐ | Built-in auth, PostgreSQL, free tier, Vercel-friendly | Learning curve |
| Vercel Postgres | Native integration | No built-in auth |
| MongoDB Atlas | Flexible schema | Overkill for this use case |
| PlanetScale | MySQL, serverless | No built-in auth |

**My Recommendation: Node.js + Supabase**
- Supabase provides authentication out-of-the-box (handles student ID, email, password)
- Free tier is generous
- Works seamlessly with Vercel
- PostgreSQL for reliable data storage

---

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Project Setup
1. Initialize Node.js backend with Vercel serverless functions
2. Set up Supabase project and configure authentication
3. Create database schema (users, resources, stars)

### Phase 2: Authentication System
1. Create registration API (student ID, email, password)
2. Create login/logout API
3. Add session management with JWT tokens
4. Update index.html - add login button (top-right), user info display, logout button

### Phase 3: Starring Feature
1. Create API endpoints for starring/unstarring resources
2. Create API to fetch star counts for ranking
3. Update resource pages to show star buttons (for logged-in users)
4. Implement ranking logic based on star counts

### Phase 4: Frontend Integration
1. Add auth state management in script.js
2. Create login/register modal UI
3. Add star buttons to resource listings
4. Display ranked resources based on stars

## Questions for You

Before proceeding, please confirm:

1. **Stack**: Node.js + Supabase - acceptable?
2. **Student ID format**: Any specific validation rules (e.g., must be 8 digits)?
3. **Which pages have resources to star?** (courses.html, tools.html, materials.html, etc.)
4. **Do you already have a Supabase account**, or should I include setup instructions?

Let me know your decisions and I'll start implementing!

User: Student ID format: must be at least 10 digits.
Pages with resources to star: attached with the prompt
I do not have a supabase account, please guide me


GitHub Copilot: Let me first check the current index.html structure, then create a detailed implementation plan with Supabase setup instructions.  

Read [](file:///e%3A/Git_WIP/2.%20Personal%20Repositories/ou1ts.portal/index.html#1-1), lines 1 to 100

Read [](file:///e%3A/Git_WIP/2.%20Personal%20Repositories/ou1ts.portal/script.js#1-1), lines 1 to 100

Now I have a clear picture of the project. Here's the **complete implementation plan** with Supabase setup instructions:

---

# Complete Implementation Plan

## Part 1: Supabase Account Setup (Do This First)

### Step 1: Create Supabase Account
1. Go to **https://supabase.com**
2. Click **"Start your project"** → Sign up with GitHub (recommended)
3. Create a new organization (your name or "ou1ts")

### Step 2: Create a New Project
1. Click **"New Project"**
2. Fill in:
   - **Name:** `ou1ts-portal`
   - **Database Password:** (save this somewhere safe!)
   - **Region:** Choose closest to your users (Singapore for Bangladesh)
3. Click **"Create new project"** (takes 2-3 minutes)

### Step 3: Get Your API Keys
After project is ready, go to **Settings → API**. You'll need:
- **Project URL:** `https://xxxxx.supabase.co`
- **anon (public) key:** `eyJhbGc...` (safe for frontend)

### Step 4: Set Up Database Schema
Go to **SQL Editor** in Supabase dashboard and run this:

```sql
-- Create profiles table (extends auth.users)
CREATE TABLE public.profiles (
  id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE PRIMARY KEY,
  student_id TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  email TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Create stars table
CREATE TABLE public.stars (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES public.profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
  resource_type TEXT NOT NULL,  -- 'community', 'courses', 'materials', etc.
  resource_id TEXT NOT NULL,    -- unique identifier for each resource
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(user_id, resource_type, resource_id)
);

-- Create index for faster star counting
CREATE INDEX idx_stars_resource ON public.stars(resource_type, resource_id);

-- Enable Row Level Security
ALTER TABLE public.profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.stars ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Profiles policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own profile" ON public.profiles
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = id);
  
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own profile" ON public.profiles
  FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = id);

-- Stars policies  
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view star counts" ON public.stars
  FOR SELECT USING (true);
  
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can star" ON public.stars
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
  
CREATE POLICY "Users can unstar own stars" ON public.stars
  FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Function to create profile on signup
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO public.profiles (id, student_id, email)
  VALUES (
    NEW.id,
    NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'student_id',
    NEW.email
  );
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

-- Trigger to auto-create profile
CREATE TRIGGER on_auth_user_created
  AFTER INSERT ON auth.users
  FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user();
```

### Step 5: Configure Authentication
1. Go to **Authentication → Providers**
2. Email is enabled by default (perfect for your needs)
3. Go to **Authentication → URL Configuration**
4. Add your site URL (after deploying): `https://your-site.vercel.app`

| **Login/Logout** | Session-based with JWT tokens |
| **User Display** | Shows Student ID + Email in header when logged in |
| **Starring** | Logged-in users can star/unstar any resource |
| **Rankings** | Resources sorted by star count (most starred first) |
| **Persistence** | All data stored in Supabase PostgreSQL |

---

## Part 5: Environment Variables (for Vercel)

After setting up Supabase, you'll add these to Vercel:
```
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your-service-key (from Settings → API)
```

---

## Questions Before I Start

1. **Ready to proceed?** Did you complete the Supabase setup (Part 1)?
2. **Confirm email verification:** Should new users need to verify their email before logging in? (Default: No, for easier testing)
3. **Star display preference:** Show star count next to each resource, or only sort by it?

Let me know and I'll begin implementation!

User: bu my website is hosted on netlify as https://ouits-res.netlify.app/


should I set up as https://ou1ts-portal.vercel.app/ for backend?

GitHub Copilot: Great question! You have two options:

## Option A: Keep Netlify + Use Supabase Directly (Recommended)

**You don't need a separate Vercel backend at all!**

Supabase provides a JavaScript client that works directly in the browser. This means:
- Keep your site on Netlify as-is
- Add Supabase JS client to your frontend
- Auth and database operations happen directly with Supabase
- No CORS issues, no separate backend to manage

```
Your Site (Netlify) ←→ Supabase (Auth + Database)
```

**Pros:**
- Simpler architecture (one deployment)
- No CORS configuration needed
- Faster (direct connection to Supabase)
- Free tier is sufficient

---

## Option B: Netlify Frontend + Vercel Backend

```
Your Site (Netlify) ←→ Vercel API ←→ Supabase
```

**Pros:**
- More control over API logic
- Can add custom validation/business logic

**Cons:**
- CORS setup required
- Two deployments to manage
- More complex

---

## My Recommendation: Option A

For your use case (auth + starring), Supabase's client-side SDK handles everything securely with Row Level Security. No custom backend needed.

**Updated Implementation Plan:**

| What | Where |
|------|-------|
| Static HTML/CSS/JS | Netlify (keep as-is) |
| Auth (login/register/logout) | Supabase JS Client |
| Database (stars) | Supabase JS Client |
| Security | Supabase Row Level Security |

**Files to add/modify:**
```
ou1ts.portal/
├── js/
│   ├── supabase-config.js    # Supabase client init
│   ├── auth.js               # Auth functions
│   └── stars.js              # Starring functions
├── index.html                # Add login UI + scripts
├── style.css                 # Add auth/star styles
└── [all resource pages]      # Add star buttons + scripts
```

---

**Want me to proceed with Option A?** (Netlify + Supabase direct)

Once you confirm, I'll start creating the files. Just make sure to:
1. Create your Supabase account
2. Run the SQL schema I provided
3. Get your Project URL and anon key

User: please go with option A, and guide me with the connection setup of frontend and supabase

Starting: *Provide Supabase setup guide* (7/7)

All code is implemented! Now here's your **Supabase Setup Guide**:

---

## Step-by-Step Supabase Connection Setup

### 1. Create Supabase Account & Project

1. Go to **https://supabase.com** → Click **"Start your project"**
2. Sign up with **GitHub** (easiest)
3. Click **"New Project"** and fill:
   - **Name:** `ou1ts-portal`
   - **Database Password:** (save this!)
   - **Region:** Singapore (closest to Bangladesh)
4. Wait 2-3 minutes for project creation

### 2. Get Your API Keys

1. Go to **Settings** (gear icon) → **API**
2. Copy these two values:
   - **Project URL:** `https://xxxxx.supabase.co`
   - **anon public key:** `eyJhbGc...` (long string)

### 3. Update Your Config File

Open supabase-config.js and replace:

```javascript
const SUPABASE_URL = 'https://YOUR-PROJECT-ID.supabase.co';
const SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = 'your-anon-key-here';
```

### 4. Create Database Tables

1. Go to **SQL Editor** in Supabase dashboard
2. Click **"New query"**
3. Paste this SQL and click **Run**:

```sql
-- Create profiles table
CREATE TABLE public.profiles (
  id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE PRIMARY KEY,
  student_id TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  email TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Create stars table
CREATE TABLE public.stars (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES public.profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
  resource_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  resource_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(user_id, resource_type, resource_id)
);

-- Create index for faster queries
CREATE INDEX idx_stars_resource ON public.stars(resource_type, resource_id);

-- Enable Row Level Security
ALTER TABLE public.profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.stars ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Profiles policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own profile" ON public.profiles
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = id);
  
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own profile" ON public.profiles
  FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = id);

-- Stars policies  
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view star counts" ON public.stars
  FOR SELECT USING (true);
  
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can star" ON public.stars
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
  
CREATE POLICY "Users can unstar own stars" ON public.stars
  FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Auto-create profile on signup
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO public.profiles (id, student_id, email)
  VALUES (
    NEW.id,
    NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'student_id',
    NEW.email
  );
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

CREATE TRIGGER on_auth_user_created
  AFTER INSERT ON auth.users
  FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user();
```

### 5. Configure Authentication

1. Go to **Authentication** → **URL Configuration**
2. Set **Site URL:** `https://ouits-res.netlify.app`
3. Add to **Redirect URLs:** `https://ouits-res.netlify.app`

### 6. Deploy to Netlify

Push your changes to GitHub - Netlify will auto-deploy.

## Files Created/Modified

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| supabase-config.js | Supabase client initialization |
| auth.js | Login, register, logout logic |
| stars.js | Star/unstar and ranking logic |
| index.html | Added login button + auth modal |
| style.css | Auth modal + star button styles |
| All resource pages | Added star buttons + auth UI |

---

## How It Works

1. **Login button** appears on all pages (top-right)
2. **Register** with Student ID (10+ digits), email, password
3. **Stars** appear on each resource - click to star/unstar
4. **Resources sort** by star count (most starred first)
5. **Session persists** across pages

Let me know when you've completed the Supabase setup and I can help test!

User: #target: making a new page, contributions.html

#idea: 
- the new page will be linked in index.html under "Official UITS" category, with a bar separating from the rest.
- the pageis for listing the contributors who have submitted their resource info through the "Submit Resource" button.
- as a reference, use this website: https://diuqbank.com/contributors/
- state the reference clearly at the very bottom of the new page.
- keep the CSS theme consistent with index.html and the other category pages
- do not change anything else other than index.html.

Now I have all the context I need. Let me create the contributions.html page and update index.html. I'll:

1. Create contributions.html with a contributors list layout inspired by the reference website
2. Update index.html to add a link to contributions.html under the "Official UITS" category with a divider 

Created [](file:///e%3A/Git_WIP/2.%20Personal%20Repositories/ou1ts.portal/contributions.html)

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
I've completed both tasks:

1. **Created contributions.html** - A new page for listing contributors who submit resources through the "Submit Resource" button. The page includes:
   - Header with back button, icon, and "Submit Resource" button
   - An info banner explaining the page's purpose
   - An empty state with a call-to-action for first-time contributors
   - A commented-out contributors grid template ready to be populated when contributors are added
   - Reference footer at the bottom crediting the design inspiration from https://diuqbank.com/contributors/

2. **Updated index.html** - Added the "Contributors" category card under "Official UITS" with:
   - A horizontal divider separating it from the other categories
   - A green-themed icon (fa-users) with matching gradient background
   - Description "Resource Submitters"

The CSS styling is consistent with the existing pages, using the same color scheme, card styles, and layout patterns.

User: let's brainstorm.

I am taking the submissions by a Google Form, that will be stored in a Google Sheet. But then I will have to manually update the website contents as I add the submitted resources to the intended locations. 
Is there a way to automate this process? Can a website pull data directly from Google Sheet? For example, any new submissions will add a new section in the contributions.html

GitHub Copilot: Yes, absolutely! There are several ways to pull data directly from Google Sheets to your website. Here are the main options:

## Option 1: Published Google Sheet (Simplest - No API Key)

1. **Publish your Google Sheet** to the web (File → Share → Publish to web)
2. Use the sheet's public JSON/CSV endpoint
3. Fetch with JavaScript and render dynamically

```javascript
// Example: Fetch from published sheet
const SHEET_ID = 'your-sheet-id';
const SHEET_NAME = 'Form Responses 1';
const url = `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/${SHEET_ID}/gviz/tq?tqx=out:json&sheet=${SHEET_NAME}`;

fetch(url)
  .then(res => res.text())
  .then(data => {
    // Parse and render contributors
  });
```

**Pros:** Free, no API key, simple  
**Cons:** Data is publicly accessible, slight delay in updates

---

## Option 2: Google Sheets API (More Control)

- Requires a Google Cloud project and API key
- More reliable and structured responses
- Can handle private sheets with OAuth

---

## Option 3: Third-Party Services

| Service | Free Tier | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| **SheetDB** | 500 req/month | Easy REST API |
| **Sheety** | 200 req/month | Simple JSON API |
| **Sheet.best** | 100 req/month | Quick setup |

---

## My Recommendation for Your Use Case

**Option 1 (Published Sheet)** is ideal because:
- Your data isn't sensitive (contributor names are public anyway)
- Zero cost
- No backend needed
- Works with your static HTML site

Would you like me to implement this for contributions.html? I would:

1. Add JavaScript to fetch data from your Google Sheet
2. Dynamically render contributor cards based on form responses
3. The page will auto-update whenever new submissions are added to the sheet

Just share your Google Sheet ID (or the form response sheet), and let me know which columns contain the contributor info (name, ID, etc.).

User: please do. Here is the Google Sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oQ5Mkavjm62UGZwNjM-52yvKppWZHfX-Qpq6jtEVIOY/edit?usp=sharing

What steps do I need to follow?

GitHub Copilot: Read [](file:///e%3A/Git_WIP/2.%20Personal%20Repositories/ou1ts.portal/contributions.html#1-1), lines 1 to 220

Read [](file:///e%3A/Git_WIP/2.%20Personal%20Repositories/ou1ts.portal/contributions.html#220-220), lines 220 to 249

Now I need to check your Google Sheet structure to understand the column names. But first, here are the steps you need to follow:

---

## Steps You Need to Follow:

### Step 1: Publish Your Google Sheet to the Web
1. Open your Google Sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oQ5Mkavjm62UGZwNjM-52yvKppWZHfX-Qpq6jtEVIOY/
2. Go to **File → Share → Publish to web**
3. In the dialog:
   - Select the sheet tab that contains form responses (usually "Form Responses 1")
   - Choose **"Entire Document"** or the specific sheet
   - Click **"Publish"**
4. Confirm by clicking "OK"

### Step 2: Tell Me Your Column Names
What are the column headers in your Google Form responses? For example:
- Timestamp
- Name
- Email
- Student ID
- Resource Link
- etc.

---

Once you confirm the sheet is published and share the column names, I'll update contributions.html to automatically fetch and display contributors from the sheet.

**Quick question:** Would you like to display:
- **All unique contributors** (grouped by name, showing count of submissions)?
- **OR each individual submission** as a separate entry?

User: I want to display "All unique contributors" grouped by "Your Name"

Here are the column names: Timestamp	Email Address	Student Education Email	What is this submission for?	Your Name	Contacts and Social Links	Project Title	Project Link	Project Type	Department	Batch

GitHub Copilot: Using "Replace String in File"


```

```


Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Done! I've updated contributions.html to automatically fetch and display contributors from your Google Sheet.

## What You Need to Do:

### Publish Your Google Sheet to the Web
1. Open your sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oQ5Mkavjm62UGZwNjM-52yvKppWZHfX-Qpq6jtEVIOY/
2. Go to **File → Share → Publish to web**
3. Click **"Publish"** and confirm

That's it! Once published, the page will automatically:
- Fetch all form submissions
- Group by **"Your Name"** column
- Display unique contributors sorted by number of submissions (highest first)
- Show their **Department** and **Batch** as subtitle
- Show colorful avatar with initials
- Auto-update whenever new submissions are added (on page refresh)

## Features Implemented:
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Loading state** | Shows spinner while fetching data |
| **Empty state** | Displays if no submissions yet |
| **Error state** | Shows if fetch fails |
| **Dynamic avatars** | Colored circles with initials |
| **Contribution count** | Shows number of resources submitted |
| **Sorted by contributions** | Top contributors appear first |

Made changes.

User: the empty state is not working

GitHub Copilot: Read [](file:///e%3A/Git_WIP/2.%20Personal%20Repositories/ou1ts.portal/contributions.html#180-180), lines 180 to 280

I see the issue. The problem is that if the Google Sheet isn't published yet or the fetch fails silently, the error might not be caught properly. Also, if the sheet has a header row, it might be counted as data. Let me fix the script with better error handling and skip the header row: 

Read [](file:///e%3A/Git_WIP/2.%20Personal%20Repositories/ou1ts.portal/contributions.html#280-280), lines 280 to 389

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Fixed! The changes include:

1. **Better error handling** - Now properly catches network errors and invalid responses
2. **Validates Google Sheet response format** - Checks if the sheet is actually published
3. **Skips header rows** - Filters out rows where the name equals "Your Name" (column header)
4. **Proper display styling** - Changed `display: block` to `display: flex` for centered content

**Important:** Have you published your Google Sheet to the web yet? If not:

1. Open: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oQ5Mkavjm62UGZwNjM-52yvKppWZHfX-Qpq6jtEVIOY/
2. Go to **File → Share → Publish to web**
3. Select **"Entire Document"** and click **Publish**

If it's still showing the loading spinner or error state, open the browser console (F12 → Console tab) and let me know what error message appears.

Now I have the full picture. I need to:
1. Add modal CSS styles
2. Add modal HTML structure
3. Update column indices to include email, project title, link, and type
4. Store all submissions per contributor (not just count)
5. Add click handler to show modal with resources 

Using "Multi-Replace String in Files"


```

```
Done! I've updated contributions.html with the following features:

### New Features Added:

1. **Student Education Email Display**
   - Now shows the contributor's education email below their name on each card

2. **Clickable Cards with Modal Popup**
   - Clicking any contributor card opens a modal/popup window
   - Modal shows:
     - Contributor's name and email in the header
     - Avatar with initials
     - List of all submitted resources with:
       - **Project Title**
       - **Project Type** (as a badge)
       - **Project Link** (clickable, opens in new tab)

3. **Modal Interactions**
   - Click the ✕ button to close
   - Click outside the modal to close
   - Press **Escape** key to close
   - Smooth slide-in animation

### Column Mapping Updated:
| Index | Column Name |
|-------|-------------|
| 2 | Student Education Email |
| 4 | Your Name |
| 6 | Project Title |
| 7 | Project Link |

User: Supabase has email rate limit, that I want to bypass using another service. What options do we have? Google OAuth or Firebase or anything else?

GitHub Copilot: Here are your options to bypass Supabase's email rate limits:

## Option 1: Social OAuth Providers (Recommended)
No email sending required - users authenticate directly with the provider.

| Provider | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **Google OAuth** | Most users have Google; easy setup | Requires Google Cloud Console config |
| **GitHub OAuth** | Great for developer audience | Limited to users with GitHub accounts |
| **Discord OAuth** | Good for community apps | Limited audience |
| **Facebook OAuth** | Wide user base | Complex approval process |

**Supabase supports all of these natively** - just enable in Dashboard → Authentication → Providers.

---

## Option 2: Custom SMTP (Your Own Email Server)
Use your own email service instead of Supabase's built-in:

| Service | Free Tier | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| **Resend** | 3,000 emails/month | Modern API, easy setup |
| **SendGrid** | 100 emails/day | Popular, reliable |
| **Mailgun** | 1,000 emails/month | Good deliverability |
| **AWS SES** | 62,000/month (from EC2) | Cheapest at scale |
| **Brevo (Sendinblue)** | 300 emails/day | Good free tier |

Configure in Supabase: Dashboard → Project Settings → Auth → SMTP Settings

---

## Option 3: Firebase Auth (Replace Supabase Auth)
Use Firebase only for authentication, keep Supabase for database:
- Higher email limits
- Phone auth included
- More OAuth providers
- Adds complexity (two services)

---

## My Recommendation

**Google OAuth** is the best option because:
1. Zero email rate limits
2. Most UITS students likely have Google accounts (education email)
3. Native Supabase support
4. Fast sign-in (one click)
5. No additional costs

Would you like me to implement Google OAuth for your project? I'll need you to:
1. Create a project in [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Enable OAuth 2.0 credentials
3. Share the Client ID and redirect URI

User: can I use Resend for this purpose? what are the coss?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, **Resend** is an excellent choice for Supabase custom SMTP. Here's the breakdown:

## Resend Pricing

| Plan | Price | Emails/Month | Rate Limit |
|------|-------|--------------|------------|
| **Free** | $0 | 3,000 | 100/day |
| **Pro** | $20/month | 50,000 | 500/second |
| **Enterprise** | Custom | Unlimited | Custom |

**Free tier is likely enough** for your use case (contributors submitting resources).

---

## Setup Steps

### 1. Create Resend Account
1. Go to [resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Sign up (free)
3. Verify your domain OR use their test domain for development

### 2. Get API Key
1. Dashboard → API Keys → Create API Key
2. Copy the key (starts with `re_`)

### 3. Configure in Supabase
Go to **Supabase Dashboard → Project Settings → Auth → SMTP Settings**:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Host | `smtp.resend.com` |
| Port | `465` |
| Username | `resend` |
| Password | Your API key (`re_...`) |
| Sender email | `noreply@yourdomain.com` or `onboarding@resend.dev` (for testing) |

---

## Pros & Cons of Resend

**Pros:**
- Modern, developer-friendly API
- Great deliverability
- Simple setup
- Generous free tier (3,000/month)
- Works perfectly with Supabase

**Cons:**
- 100 emails/day limit on free tier (resets daily)
- Need to verify domain for production (or use their test domain)

---

## Comparison: Resend vs Google OAuth

| Factor | Resend (SMTP) | Google OAuth |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| **User Experience** | Email + password + verification | One-click sign in |
| **Setup Complexity** | Medium | Medium |
| **Cost** | Free (3,000/month) | Free (unlimited) |
| **Rate Limits** | 100/day free | None |
| **Email Required** | Yes | No |

**Verdict:** If you want to keep email/password auth, Resend is great. If you want the smoothest UX with no limits, Google OAuth is better.

Would you like me to help you set up Resend with Supabase, or would you prefer to go with Google OAuth?

User: let's go with Google OAuth

Now I'll add Google OAuth support to your auth system. Here's what you need to do:

---

## Step 1: Set Up Google Cloud Console

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project (or select existing)
3. Go to **APIs & Services → Credentials**
4. Click **Create Credentials → OAuth client ID**
5. Select **Web application**
6. Add these **Authorized redirect URIs**:
   - `https://gcegxwqdztlgqewmvteh.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`
7. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

---

## Step 2: Configure Supabase

1. Go to your [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project → **Authentication → Providers**
3. Find **Google** and enable it
4. Paste your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
5. Save

- Updated files: index.html, tools.html, portfolios.html, guidance.html

### 3. CSS (style.css)
- `.google-login-btn` - White button with Google icon
- `.auth-divider` - Horizontal line with text

---

## Steps You Need to Complete:

### 1. Google Cloud Console
1. Go to [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create project → **APIs & Services → Credentials**
3. **Create Credentials → OAuth client ID → Web application**
4. Add redirect URI:
   ```
   https://gcegxwqdztlgqewmvteh.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback
   ```
5. Copy **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

### 2. Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to **Authentication → Providers → Google**
2. Enable it
3. Paste Client ID and Client Secret
4. Save

---

Once configured, users will see a **"Continue with Google"** button at the top of the login/register modal. One click and they're authenticated - no email rate limits!
